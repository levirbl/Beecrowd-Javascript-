## Solved Problems in Beecrowd/URI platmorm in JavaScript

In this repository you will find some problems solved in Javascript on the Beecrowd/URI platform. The purpose is to help you solve such problems or to help you correct errors in your code. Enjoy! :)

On the Beecrowd / URI platform the prompt is not recognized, so we put a simple variable at the beginning of the code:

~~~javascript
let prompt = text => { return lines.shift(); };
~~~

After that, we can use the prompt safely and properly.
